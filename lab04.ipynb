It should take one argument, a DataFrame `df` with a single column column called `'serial_number'` (like `observations`).  It should plot a histogram of the values in the `'serial_number'` column **using bins of width 1** ranging from **1 to 200 (inclusive)** but return nothing.  Then, call that function to make a histogram of `observations`."
